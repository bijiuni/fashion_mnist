# Optimization Methods Comparison on Fashion MNIST Dataset using Keras

## Overview

This project tries to evaluate different optimazation strategies.

Fashion MNIST is a replacement for the MNIST dataset, it is more effective for benchmarking on modern algorithms. The dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. Images are split into a training set (60,000 images) and a test set (10,000 images).

The optimization methods evaluate are: SGD, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam.
